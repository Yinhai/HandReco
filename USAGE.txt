How to Run With Jython
----------------------

Install jython 2.5.2

Run the .py file with jython in the way that is simplest on your system.

Example:

1. Open a terminal (Windows users can go to the run dialog and then type cmd. (I think so at least))
2. cd to the src directory
3. jython __run__.py


See the file src/__run__.py for an example of how to set up sys.path and how to import classes in different files and packages.
