HandReco
========
HandReco is an experiment with the aim to create a system for handwriting recognition using a Hidden Markov Model. We will assume
that characters are separated. If time permits we will extend the system to support word recognition where the letters in the word may be
connected. 

We will first try the system with Latin characters and then with a few Chinese characters and compare the result.
